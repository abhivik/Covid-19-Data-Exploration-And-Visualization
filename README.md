# Covid19 Data Exploration and Visualization

## Introduction

This project focuses on exploring and visualizing Covid19 data using various tools, including DBeaver, XAMPP, Jupyter Notebook, Python with Pandas, and Tableau. The dataset, obtained from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths), undergoes cleaning, exploration in DBeaver, and subsequent analysis in Jupyter Notebook. The project culminates in visually impactful Tableau dashboards presenting insights into the Covid19 status.

## Project Overview

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Obtained the Covid19 dataset from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).
2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Cleaned the dataset in Excel by removing unwanted columns, ensuring a streamlined dataset.
3. **Data Exploration Using DBeaver:**
   - Utilized DBeaver and MySQL for data exploration, gaining insights into the Covid19 dataset.
4. **Data Analysis in Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Faced processing issues for large queries in DBeaver, leading to the use of the Pandasql library in Python within a Jupyter Notebook to efficiently handle and analyze the data.
5. **Extraction of Data Exploration Results:**
   - Extracted meaningful values and insights derived from the data exploration phase.
6. **Tableau Visualization:**
   - Prepared visually informative Tableau dashboards showcasing key insights and trends related to Covid19 data.

## What I Did

1. **Data Cleaning:**
